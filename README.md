# Metabarcoding Workshop MMBL
## Workshop Description
The advent of cheaper high-throughput sequencing facilitated an explosion in microbiome datasets. Becoming increasingly available and denser, researchers are now inundated by huge microbiome/metabarcoding datasets that are sometimes misanalyzed or left unanalyzed due to either unavaibility of computers with sufficient computational power or, which is mostly the case, lack of data analysis skills.

The main objective of this workshop is to give MMBL students and research associates a hands-on experience in working with microbiome datasets and introduce them to the common tools used in analyzing metabarcodes.

This workshop includes:
1. Brief introduction to bioinformatics and related tools
2. 16S microbiome analysis using QIIME2 
2a. Community analysis
2b. Navigating Jupyterlab
2c. QIIME2, what gives?
2d. Data cleaning
2e. Microbiome community analysis
3. ITS2 Symbiodiniaceae workflow in R and RStudio
3a. Symportal, what gives?
3b. Data cleaning
3c. ITS2 community analysis
