# Metabarcoding Workshop MMBL
## Workshop Description
The advent of high-throughput sequencing and its lowering costs facilitated an explosion in microbiome datasets. Becoming increasingly available and denser, researchers are now inundated by huge microbiome/metabarcoding datasets that are sometimes misanalyzed or left unanalyzed due to either the unavailability of computers with sufficient computational power or, which is mostly the case, lack of data analysis skills.

The main objective of this workshop is to give MMBL students and research associates a hands-on experience in working with microbiome datasets and introduce them to the common tools used in analyzing metabarcodes.

This workshop includes:

1 Brief introduction to bioinformatics and related tools

2 16S microbiome analysis using QIIME2 
- Short intro to Metabarcoding, community analysis and QIIME2
- Short intro to CLI and navigating through JLab
- Micriobiome community analysis (demo)

3 ITS2 Symbiodiniaceae workflow in R and RStudio
- Symportal, what gives?
- Ecological statistics, reitration
- Short intro to R
- Sample Symportal run and downstream analyses
